v3.0.0 2025-07-07

Breaking:

* refactor: rename name/address labels to dev_name/dev_address
* fix: remove "dynamic" labels - like status, running; add separate metrics


Features:

* arp: generate metrics for each entry can be disabled
* capsman: add new metrics to capsman collector
* capsman: option for enable/disable station metrics
* dhcpl: option for gather details about leases; add overall statistics
* neighbour: metrics per each discovered device can be enabled.
* wireguard: allow user to enable detailed info about peers
* wireguard: collect running status
* add basic /disk collector
* add basic dude collector
* add certs collector (monitor certificates expiration date)
* add collector for /ip/dns/adlist
* add collector for /ip/service active connections
* add collector for /ipt/neighbor entries
* add collector for /ipv6 neighbor metrics
* add ip (fasttrack, fast-path) collector
* add ntp/sntp client metrics collector
* add ppp collector
* add prometheus process collector
* add radius/incoming metrics
* add tx-queue-drop for interfaces; ignore lo interface
* detect firmware version for device
* do not try collect for incompatible RO version (adlist, wg)
* new config file format: move configuration to collectors (scripts, firewall, wireguard)
* update grafana dashboard

Fix:

* adlist: collect only active lists
* arp: to not collect failed entries
* capsman: collect only not-disabled interface; drop _disabled metric
* dhcp6: collect only active servers
* dhcp: collect only active servers
* dhcpl: collect all statuses; add dhcp_address, dhcp_macaddress
* dhcpl: rename metric status->leases_by_status
* do not panic on unknown collectors; show error and ignore
* fix log-format cli argument; default option depend on tty etc
* fix parsing duration with ms,us
* get version from resource for compatibility with ChR
* interfaces: skip disabled interfaces
* monitor: skip disabled interfaces
* optics: skip disabled interfaces
* process services-defined devices parallel; not wait for identity.
* queue: skip disabled simple queues; drop _disabled metric
* wireguard: skip disabled interfaces; fix missing wg metrics; fix names


Tests:

* use testify for routeros test
* fix tests


Refactor:

* simplify code
* move to internal/; reorganize packages
* redesign pool collector; load directly used/total ipv4 pool props


Chore: 

* update Makefile, .air.toml, .gitignore
* update deps


v2.0.2 2025-03-07
=================

* fix: fix handle empty response from routeros
* tests: fix routeros.proto tests
* chore: fix linter errors


v2.0.1 2024-04-22
=================

* dev: include stripped down routeros package
* dev: remove doubled code, simplify code
* feat: add systemd support (watchdog, notifications)


v2.0.0 2024-03-31
=================

* fix: keep open connection if device is not dynamic (srv-defined); this
  prevent many login/logout entries in routeros log
* fix: change some metrics names to Prometheus standards
* fix: do not stop reading metrics with one fail (i.e. not available in this
  device); log this errors
* feat: add possibility to configure profiles with collectors that can be run
  on specified targets
* feat: TLS and timeout is configurable per device
* feat: add support for web-config (i.e. configure exporter TLS and
  authentication)
* feat: add --list-collectors flag
* feat: add --with-all to enable all collectors from command line
* feat: allow user to disable by device configuration collecting IPv6 related
  metrics
* feat: new exporter metric: mikrotik_scrape_errors
* dev: refactor, clean code; update deps.
* remove broken bgp collector

Updated collectors:
* dhcpl: remove unstable labels from metrics
* wlanif: collect statistics for disabled wifi interfaces
* wlanif: collect interface frequency
* capsman: collect provision status
* system: add cpu-freq, bad-block, cpu-count metrics
* resource: separate metrics for border name and version
* lte, queue, wlanif: handle empty api response
* ipsec: fix collector, add peers metrics


New collectors:
* queue - queue and simple queue
* cloud - cloud status
* arp - IPv4 only
* dns - dns cache statistics
* scripts - metrics from user-defined scripts (defined per device)
